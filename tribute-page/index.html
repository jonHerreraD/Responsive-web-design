        <h2>Avenged Sevenfold Career Timeline</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>1999 - Formation</h3>
            <p>Avenged Sevenfold was formed in Huntington Beach, California by teenage friends Matt Sanders (M. Shadows), James Sullivan (The Rev), Zachary Baker (Zacky Vengeance), and Matt Wendt. The band's name was inspired by the biblical story of Cain and Abel. What started as a garage band among high school friends would eventually grow into one of the most successful metal acts of the 2000s. At this early stage, they were simply four young musicians experimenting with their sound and learning their craft.</p>

            <h3>2001 - Debut Album</h3>
            <p>The band released their first studio album "Sounding the Seventh Trumpet" when the members were just eighteen years old. Originally released on Good Life Recordings, this debut showcased their early metalcore sound with aggressive screaming vocals and heavy breakdowns. The album was raw and unpolished compared to their later works, but it demonstrated the band's potential. While it didn't achieve commercial success, it served as an important stepping stone and helped them gain a small but dedicated following.</p>

Johnny Christ replaced Matt Wendt on bass, completing what would become the classic Avenged Sevenfold lineup. These lineup changes brought new energy and musical chemistry to the band, with Synyster Gates' guitar skills perfectly complementing Zacky Vengeance's rhythm work. The addition of these members marked the beginning of the band's more serious approach to their music and career.</p>
